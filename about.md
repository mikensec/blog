Born in Caracas Venezuela. Living in Texas. Sysadmin pursuing a career in cybersecurity/red team.

In this blog I will be adding articles related to hacking, and other IT related topics I find interesting. Hopefully one of my articles can help somebody struggling with an issue. 

You can find me on Twitter or HackTheBox.eu:
