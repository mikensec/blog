Born in Venezuela. Living in Texas. I'm a father, ethical hacker, bug bounty hunter, eternal student, certs holder. Working to move into a red team role. 
 
In this blog I will be adding articles related to hacking, and other IT related topics I find interesting. Hopefully one of my articles can help somebody struggling with an issue. 

You can find me on Twitter or HackTheBox.eu:
